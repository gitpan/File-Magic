File-Magic version 0.01
=======================

This module covers simply getting the file type by using magic_file from
libmagic(3) from Ian F. Darwin, Måns Rullgård and Christos Zoulas.
The main improvement is no fork(2) is required to get the type of a file
and an impressive speed improvement come with that when a lot of files
needs to be typed ;-) 

Read the module's POD for more information.
